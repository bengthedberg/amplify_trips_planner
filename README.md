# amplify_trips_planner

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Notes

The Amplify CLI will add a new folder named `amplify` to the app's root folder, which contains the amplify project and backend details. It will also add a new dartfile (`amplifyconfiguration.dart`) to `lib/` folder. The app will use this file to know how to reach your provisioned backend resources at runtime.
